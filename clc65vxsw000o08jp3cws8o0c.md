Microvest is a platform that carried out simple stock investment, savings, savings with interest, basic money transfers and a mini Social platform. The application is only available on Andriod OS and the web ([app.microvest.ng](http://app.microvest.ng)) for now.

It is for individuals that want to live on a budget and want to discipline themselves based on goals they have in mind. Creating plans for themselves and working by them.

## What Problem is being solved?

Due to the lack of budgeting and sticking with a budget, Microvest assists users to create goals that will help them perfect their budget and stick with it. But just saving is a waste of time. Saving without returns makes money redundant. Microvest helps users save with good investments to choose from.

Microvest uses similar features as the likes of Carbon, Piggyvest and Cowrywise (Each with its distinct differences).

Its savings platform also acts as an investment platform helping every user gain money while saving.

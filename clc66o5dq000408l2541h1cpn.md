Habari App was the first mobile platform in Nigeria created by a financial institution that focuses on enabling people’s needs and lifestyles rather than providing a limited bouquet or regular banking products.

It was a one-stop shop for everything lifestyle, chatting, payment and fun.

The application, which is now retired, had a great run. Here are a few things to note about the application.

 **STRENGTH:**

·  Is a one in all app, combining Shop, Games, Music, and Videos

**WEAKNESS:**

·  Due to its expressive nature and its multiple features, it is hard to really niche the application to a particular subject.

·  Each feature has multiple competitors.

·  The app might not be used to its total capacity by most of its users.

·  It has a web-like loading feel which isn’t an attractive experience.

·  It doesn’t have a great marketing presence.

**OPPORTUNITY:**

·  It has the ability to be a go-to product for everyday activities.

·  Breaking features into multiple applications could further help in promoting the application.

·  Credit purchase is an option that can be explored (with interest).

**THREAT:**

·  Will attract multiple competitors’ attacks

It has the capability of dying out within a few periods of years

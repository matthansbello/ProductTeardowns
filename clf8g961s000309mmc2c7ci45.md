For young children that do not know about the Bible and God (Jesus), Bible for Kids is a product that helps parents guide their children via bible stories and simple quizzes.

The product is built for children, kids, and people with no knowledge of God but is handled by parents.

The product is free and no money is made from it.

## ISSUES 

* A Crash is required when the download is activated before the download continues in the background.
    
* Lack of variety in the gameplay
    
* The time of watching the picture animation is too much
    
* Labelling seems distorted when selecting multiple pictures 
    
* The activity for the picture (In the Beginning), labels 8 days instead of 7. God rested on day 7 not day 8.
    
* Options 6,7,8 images are too similar. 
    
* Sign-in via Google is not available but is available on YouVersion which is connected to the Bible for Kids App
    
* Repetition of pictures. Low creativity in gameplay.
    
* The Final Promise, Slide 3: The image does not depict what the scripture entails.
    

### Every other level in this game-like product will likely have a lot of functional errors and/or biblical errors.

## SUGGESTIONS

* The user experience should be reviewed.
    
* Use numbers for numbering instead of the spelt word 
    
* The name should be changed to Bible Stories for Kids.
